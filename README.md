Requirements

To run this project, you need:
Libraries:

    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    sklearn

Software:

    Python 3.8 or later
    Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Installation:

You can install the required libraries using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Use

    Prepare the Data:
        Place the dataset file (Volleyball_Stas.xlsx) in the working directory.

    Load and Preprocess Data:
        Use the notebook to load and preprocess the data for analysis.

    Run the suggest_metrics Function:
        Input the opponent team name to receive suggestions for key metrics to focus on.
        Example:

        opponent_name = "Timber Creek (Fort Worth, TX)"
        result = suggest_metrics(df, features, opponent_name)
        print(result)

    Visualize Results:
        Use the confusion matrix code to evaluate the performance of the prediction model.

Example Workflow

    Data Loading: Load the Volleyball_Stas.xlsx file into a DataFrame:

    df = pd.read_excel("Volleyball_Stas.xlsx")

    Train a Logistic Regression Model:
        Split the data into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.
        Train the model and evaluate its performance using the confusion matrix.

    Run the Metric Suggestion Tool:
        Input an opponent's name to get actionable recommendations.

    Visualize:
        Generate plots such as confusion matrices for better understanding.
